# SmartReviwPad - An Anki Add-on for effective reviewing

## Introduction

SmartReviewPad is an Anki add-on that helps you review your cards more effectively. It is based on the idea of [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2) and [Anki Simulator](
https://pheartheceal.github.io/anki-optimizer/). It is designed to be used with the [Anki Simulator](https://pheartheceal.github.io/anki-optimizer/) to optimize your Anki settings.

## Features

- **Interactive Front Side**: You can interact with the front side of your cards. This allows you to answer questions, fill in the blanks, etc. directly on the front side of your cards. This is especially useful for language learning.
- **Automatic Back Side**: The back side of your cards is automatically generated based on the front side. This allows you to create cards more quickly.
- **Automatic Review**: You can review your cards directly in the editor. This allows you to review your cards more effectively.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of SmartReviewPad from [here](https://github.com/Dor-sketch/Anki-SmartReviewPad.git).
2. Copy the `SmartReviewPad` folder to your Anki add-ons folder. You can find the add-ons folder by going to `Tools > Add-ons > View Files...` in Anki.
3. Restart Anki.

## Usage
